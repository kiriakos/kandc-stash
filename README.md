# A filesystem based image gallery for the web

* PHP based.
* Based on a weird configuration based DI container I dreamt
  up one night.

## Usage:
* Load the contents of /app/ up to a web acessible directory 
  (does not need t be a webroot).
* Add files and folders to /app/assets.
* Make sure the apache process can write into /app/images and /app/thumbnails
* Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled

## Notes:
* Use the deploy.sh script only from this directory.
* Use the deploy script only if you are kiriakos.
